This is because MSE is a commonly used metric for regression problems, and it provides a measure of the average squared distance between the predicted and actual values. Since the goal is to predict house prices based on several characteristics, the model should be optimized to minimize the difference between predicted and actual prices.\n",

After training the model, you could use the test set to evaluate its performance using MSE. A lower MSE value indicates better model performance, as it indicates that the predicted values are closer to the actual values.\n",
